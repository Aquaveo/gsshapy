Abstraction
***********

The abstraction of GsshaPy is the GSSHA model file. There are many input and ouput
files that make up a GSSHA model. Each model file is represented in the GsshaPy ORM
by a ``GsshaPyFileObject``. This object contains the ``read()`` and ``write()`` 
methods that are used to read the file into an SQL database. There may also be one
or more ``TableObjects`` that are used to create tables for storing and organizing
the file data in the relational database fashion.

Both the ``TableObjects`` and the ``GsshaPyFileObjects`` inherit from the SQLAlchemy
declarative base class As a result, each object maps to a table in the database where 
each record in the table is one object. For an explanation of the SQLAlchemy ORM see
http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/orm/tutorial.html. If you are not familiar with
SQLAlchemy, it strongly recommended that you follow this tutorial before you continue,
because GsshaPy relies on SQLAlchemy ORM concepts.

For this tutorial, we will play with the project file. The project file is the controlling 
file for GSSHA models. It is denoted by the ``.prj`` file extension. The class associated 
with the project file is called **ProjectFile**.
