This is a simple tutorial meant to show GsshaPy users how to use the 
GsshaPy ORM objects. The full tutorial script can be downloaded here:
:download:`tutorial-script.py <../tutorial-data/tutorial-script.py>`

Requirements
============

Since GsshaPy is meant to read GSSHA model files into a database and write
them out again, a set of example GSSHA model files will be needed for the
tutorial. These can be downloaded here:
:download:`tutorial-data.zip <../tutorial-data/tutorial-data.zip>`.

Unzip the contents of the file. This file will become the working directory 
for the tutorial. The ``tutorial-data/write`` and ``tutorial-data/db`` directories
are purposely left empty.

The tutorial uses an SQLite database. Ensure that you have SQLite installed 
on your system. Visit http://www.sqlite.org/ for download and installation
instructions. Windows users ensure that the sqlite executable is added to
your path.

Abstraction
===========

The abstraction of GsshaPy is the GSSHA model file. There are many input and ouput
files that make up a GSSHA model. Each model file is represented in the GsshaPy ORM
by a ``GsshaPyFileObject``. This object contains the ``read()`` and ``write()`` 
methods that are used to read the file into an SQL database. There may also be one
or more ``TableObjects`` that are used to create tables for storing and organizing
the file data in the relational database fashion.

Both the ``TableObjects`` and the ``GsshaPyFileObjects`` inherit from the SQLAlchemy
declarative base class As a result, each object maps to a table in the database where 
each record in the table is one object. For an explanation of the SQLAlchemy ORM see
http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/orm/tutorial.html. If you are not familiar with
SQLAlchemy, it strongly recommended that you follow this tutorial before you continue,
because GsshaPy relies on SQLAlchemy ORM concepts.

For this tutorial, we will play with the project file. The project file is the controlling 
file for GSSHA models. It is denoted by the ``.prj`` file extension. The class associated 
with the project file is called **ProjectFile**.

Initiate GsshaPy Database
=========================

The fisrt step is to create a database and populate it with all of the GsshaPy tables. For this
tutorial we will create an SQLite. This can be done by using the ``init_sqlite_db(path)`` 
method::

	>>> from gsshapy.lib import db_tools as dbt
	>>> sqlalchemy_url = dbt.init_sqlite_db('/path/to/tutorial-data/db/gsshapy_parkcity.db')
	
This method creates the SQLite database and  populates it with the GsshaPy tables returing 
the SQLAlchemy url for creating session objects. Next create an SQLAlchemy session object for
interacting with the database::
	
	>>> session = dbt.create_session(sqlalchemy_url)
	
Instantiate ProjectFile
=======================

Before we instantiate ProjectFile we need to define a few variables that will define 
our workspace. GsshaPy needs to know the directory and file name of the file that will 
be read into the database::
	
	>>> readDirectory = '/path/to/tutorial-data/directory'
	>>> filename = 'parkcity.prj'
	
Now we can create an instance of ProjectFile::

	>>> from gsshapy.orm import ProjectFile
	>>> projectFile = ProjectFile(directory=readDirectory, filename=filename, session=session)
	
Read the File into the Database
===============================

The newly created ProjectFile object has all the necessary information it needs to find
the file, parse it, and read it into the database. This is done by invoking the ``read()``
method on ``projectFile``::

	>>> projectFile.read()
	
Explore the Database
====================

To prove that the excercise has actually done something, it is userful to explore database.
Before we do this using the GsshaPy objects, lets explore a little using the ``sqlite`` commandline
utility. Open a terminal or command prompt and issue the following commands::

	$ cd /path/to/tutorial-data/db
	$ sqlite3 gsshapy_parkcity.db
	SQLite version 3.7.15.2
	Enter ".help" for instructions
	Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
	sqlite> .tables
	
.. warning::

	GSSHAPY was only tested with sqlite3. Use older versions at your own risk.
	
If the database was initialized correctly, you should see a list of about 50 or so tables. The three
letter prefix on the filename is associted with the file extension or in some cases the type of file.
Notice that there are two tables used to store project files: ``prj_project_files`` and ``prj_project_cards``.
Most of the data is stored in the ``prj_project_cards`` table. Inspect the data by issuing the following 
query::

	sqlite> SELECT * FROM prj_project_cards;
	
The project file stores all of the GSSHA model preferences using a card system. Each record in the 
``prj_project_cards`` table stores the *name* and *value* of one card in the project file.
The ``prj_project_cards`` table is related to the ``prj_project_files`` table through a foreign
key column called *projectFileID* (the column with all 1's).

Querying Using GsshaPy Objects
==============================

There are two GsshaPy classes that are associated with the two project file tables discussed above. 
The **ProjectFile** class maps to the ``prj_project_files`` table and the **ProjectCard** class 
maps to the ``prj_project_cards`` class. Instances of these classes can be used to query the
database. This will be demonstrated through a set of scenarios presently. 

Suppose we need to retrieve all of the project cards from a project file. We can use SQLAlchemy
session object and SQL expression language to do this. Back in the python console::
	
	>>> from gsshapy.orm import ProjectCard
	>>> cards = session.query(ProjectCard).filter(ProjectCard.projectFileID == 1).all()
	>>> for card in cards:
	...	print card
	...	
	
.. note::
	
	For an overview of the SQLAlchemy SQL expression language see the following tutorials:
	`Object Relational Tutorial`_ and `SQL Expression Language`_.
	
	.. _Object Relational Tutorial: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/orm/tutorial.html
	
	.. _SQL Expression Language: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/core/tutorial.html
	
The query returns a list of ProjectCard objects that represent the records in the ``prj_project_cards``
table that have *projectFileID* equal to 1, where *projectFileID* is the foreign key field used
in the relationship between the ``prj_project_cards`` and ``prj_project_files`` tables. The **ProjectCard**
class also has a relationship property called *projectFile* that maps to the associate **ProjectFile**
class. Equivilently, we can filter the query using the **ProjectFile** instance we have already created::

	>>> cards = session.query(ProjectCard).filter(ProjectCard.projectFile == projectFile).all()
	>>> for card in cards:
	...	print card
	...	
	
Alternatively, the relationship properties can be used to issue the queries to the database.
The **ProjectFile** also has a relationship property, *projectCards*, that back references the *projectFile*
property of hte **ProjectCard** class. It can be used through the instance of our **ProjectFile** class 
in this way::

	>>> cards = projectFile.projectCards
	>>> for card in cards:
	...	print card
	...	
	
The attributes of each **ProjectCard** object can be retrieved using normal dot notation. The **ProjectCard**
has two value column attributes, *name* and *value*::

	>>> for card in cards:
	...	print card.name, card.value
	...

Write From Database to File
===========================

Reading GSSHA files is only half the story. GsshaPy is also able to read a GsshaPy database and export the
data back to the proper file format.
